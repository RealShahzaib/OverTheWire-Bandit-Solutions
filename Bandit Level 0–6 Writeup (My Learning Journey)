📌 Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions and learning notes for the Bandit wargame by OverTheWire.
The goal of this project is not just to solve challenges, but to strengthen my Linux fundamentals, enumeration skills, and problem-solving mindset for cybersecurity and CTF environments.

I completed these levels as part of my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey while building a strong foundation in Linux and security concepts.

🚀 Level 0 → Level 1
🎯 Goal

Log in to the Bandit server using SSH.

🔍 Approach

This level introduced me to SSH (Secure Shell) and how remote login works in real-world environments.
I connected to the server using the provided credentials:

Username: bandit0

Password: bandit0

🧠 What I Learned

What SSH is and why it is used

How to securely log into a remote machine

Basic interaction with a remote Linux environment

This level really intrigued me because it felt like accessing an actual remote system rather than just solving a puzzle.

📂 Level 1 → Level 2
🎯 Goal

Find the password stored in a file named readme in the home directory.

🔍 Approach

After logging in, I used basic Linux commands:

ls
cat readme

The password was directly inside the readme file.

🧠 What I Learned

Basic file navigation in Linux

Using ls to list files

Using cat to read file contents

📁 Level 2 → Level 3
🎯 Goal

The password was stored in a file named -.

🔍 Problem Faced

When I tried:

cat -

It gave an error because the terminal interpreted - as a special argument instead of a filename.

🔍 Solution

I learned that adding ./ forces the terminal to treat it as a file:

cat ./-
🧠 What I Learned

How Linux handles special characters in filenames

Difference between command arguments and file paths

🧾 Level 3 → Level 4
🎯 Goal

The password was in a file with spaces and special characters in its name.

🔍 Problem Faced

Even with ./, the terminal could not recognize the file properly due to spaces in the filename.

🔍 Solution

I used quotation marks to treat the filename as a single string:

cat "./file name with spaces"
🧠 What I Learned

Handling filenames with spaces

Proper use of quotation marks in Linux

Importance of precise command syntax

🔎 Level 4 → Level 5
🎯 Goal

Find the password inside the inhere directory where only one file was human-readable.

🔍 Initial Approach

I first used:

ls -lh

to inspect file sizes and details manually.

⚡ Optimized Approach

To be more efficient, I used:

find . -type f -exec file {} + | grep text

This helped me quickly identify the only human-readable file containing the password.

🧠 What I Learned

Efficient file enumeration

Using file to detect readable files

Combining commands using pipes (|)

📊 Level 5 → Level 6
🎯 Goal

Locate a file with the following conditions:

Size: 1033 bytes

Not executable

Human-readable

🔍 Approach

Instead of manually checking each file, I refined my find command:

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep text

This allowed me to filter files based on size, permissions, and readability, leading me directly to the correct file.

🧠 What I Learned

Advanced usage of the find command

Filtering by file size and permissions

Automation instead of manual searching

🧠 Key Skills Gained (Level 0–6)

Linux Command Line Proficiency

SSH & Remote Access

File Handling & Permissions

Enumeration Techniques

Problem-Solving in CTF Environments

Handling Special Filenames in Linux

💡 Final Reflection

These early Bandit levels significantly improved my Linux fundamentals and taught me the importance of enumeration, attention to detail, and understanding how the terminal interprets commands.
Rather than blindly copying solutions, I focused on understanding the logic behind each step, which is essential for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and real-world security analysis.

This repository represents my practical journey into cybersecurity through hands-on learning and CTF-based challenges.
