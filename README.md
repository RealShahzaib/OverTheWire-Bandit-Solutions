# OverTheWire Bandit Solutions

This repository contains my complete solutions and walkthroughs for the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire.  

Bandit is designed to teach the fundamentals of Linux, command-line usage, file permissions, and basic cybersecurity concepts through hands-on challenges.

## What This Repository Includes
- Step-by-step solutions for each Bandit level
- Commands used and explanations
- My thought process and learning approach
- Notes on common mistakes and lessons learned

## Skills Practiced
- Linux command line proficiency
- SSH and remote access
- File permissions & ownership
- Encoding/decoding techniques
- Enumeration mindset
- Problem-solving in CTF-style environments

## How I Approached the Challenges
Instead of blindly copying solutions, I focused on:
- Reading level descriptions carefully
- Enumerating files and directories manually
- Testing multiple Linux commands
- Understanding why a solution works (not just the answer)

This repository reflects my practical journey in cybersecurity and CTF learning as I build a strong foundation for penetration testing and security analysis.
